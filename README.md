![alt tag](assets/socket4.png "Sockets")

A socket is one end of a connection via a computer network. Currently, communication between computers is done often with [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address). The most common sockets use [TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), which establish a connection between client and server. A socket address consists of an IP address and a [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)).
